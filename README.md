# Payroll-Tracker

## Description

My motivation was to build a webpage that can contain employees salary can keep track. I build this project to solve a problem of not being able to see and keep track of the employees name and salary. This project solves the problem of not keeping track of employees salary. During this project I learned how to loop until the user cancels. I also learned how to calculate and display the average salary and display a random employee.

## Usage

In order to use this webpage you have to click the "Add Employees" button. Then a loop of questions pop up and need to be answered to move onto the next. This loop continues until the user clicks cancel. Then the data is obtained and showed on screen from the order it is entered in.
